Image naming guide — how to name and where to place the photos

Please add the following images to `assets/images/` using these exact filenames. I mapped each filename to where the site will use it and the suggested caption (for the gallery). If you prefer different names, tell me and I'll remap them.

Timeline anchor images (one per milestone)
- 2013-where-it-started.jpg — used on the Timeline (18 May 2013)
- 2017-first-wheels.jpg — (optional) small khaki car icon placeholder will be used when missing
- 2018-new-heartbeat.jpg — used on the Timeline (26 Aug 2018)
- 2020-road-to-ido.jpg — used on the Timeline (08 Oct 2020)

Notes and tips
- Place images in `assets/images/` and then the gallery/timeline will reference them automatically if you use the exact filenames above.
- For the timeline anchor images use a horizontal crop (landscape) if possible; the gallery thumbnails will be cropped/fit via CSS.
- If you want me to import and resize the images (create web-sized thumbnails and optimize), I can add a small script (ImageMagick) to do that.

If you'd like, upload the photos here (or tell me the names you used) and I'll replace the placeholders and fine-tune captions and crops.
