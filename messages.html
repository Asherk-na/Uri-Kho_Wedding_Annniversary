          <p>Uncle Lanides, seeing the way you provide for and protect your family is a true lesson in strength. As a boilermaker, you spend your days building and fixing things with your hands, but at home, you’ve built something even more impressive: a foundation of love and security. Whether you are focused on a strategic game of chess, cheering for your favorite football team, or navigating a 4x4 trail in the Isuzu, you do it with a steady, quiet presence that speaks louder than words. Thank you for being a role model of hard work and for showing me that being an introvert is a superpower when it comes to being a devoted father and husband.</p>

          <p>Aunt Mercy, you are the heart and the light of the Uri-Khob home. Being a teacher is a calling that requires endless patience and grace, and you bring those same beautiful qualities to your role as a wife and mother. You have a wonderful way of nurturing your two daughters while supporting Uncle Lanides in everything he does. Seeing you in your traditional clothing, honoring your heritage with such elegance, reminds us all of the beauty of our Namibian roots. Thank you for your kindness, your wisdom, and for being the gentle force that keeps the family moving forward with a smile.</p>
