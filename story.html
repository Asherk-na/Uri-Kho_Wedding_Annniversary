      <h2>A message from Tomson</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Dear Uncle Lanides and Aunt Mercy,</p>
        <p>Happy 4th Wedding Anniversary! It is truly inspiring to see the life you have built together over these last four years. From your beautiful wedding to the home you’ve created for your two daughters, your journey reflects a deep and steady love.</p>
        <p>Uncle Lanides, I admire how you balance your hard work with being a devoted father and husband. Aunt Mercy, your dedication is truly shown in the kindness of your family. As you celebrate this milestone, I hope you find time to enjoy the quiet moments you both love.</p>
        <p>May your future be as bright as the Namibian sun, and may your family continue to grow in strength, love, and happiness. I am honored to be your nephew.</p>

      <h3>Anniversary Poem: Four Years of Grace</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <pre class="poem">Four years ago the colors were bright,
In khaki and maroon, a beautiful sight.
A traditional bond, a promise made true,
The journey of life started fresh for you.

A teacher’s heart and a builder’s hand,
Together you’ve built a home in this land.
With two little daughters, a joy so divine,
In your quiet love, their bright futures shine.

Through events to bond and travels so wide,
With patience and kindness always as your guide.
Though words may be few, your spirits are strong,
In the home where you both truly belong.

May the years ahead bring a light even brighter,
Making your burdens feel daily much lighter.
To Lanides and Mercy, and the family you’ve grown,
May the greatest of blessings be always your own.</pre>
